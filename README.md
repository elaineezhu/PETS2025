# Artifact Appendix

Paper title: **Echoes of Privacy: Uncovering the Profiling Practices of Voice Assistants**

Artifacts HotCRP Id: **#Enter your HotCRP Id here** (not your paper Id, but the artifacts id)

Requested Badge: Either **Available**, **Functional**, or **Reproduced**

## Description

This artifact includes automation scripts for conducting voice and web experiments with voice assistants and Google searches. It contains sample queries for both types of experiments.

- **Voice Experiments:** The `voiceassistantscript.py` script plays recorded audio queries one after another, with a one-minute delay between each playback. This delay gives the voice assistant time to finish responding to the previous query before starting the next one.

- **Web Experiments:** The `seleniumscript.py` script automates Google search experiments. By entering queries and login credentials in the code, the script logs into a Google account and submits each query automatically. This allows us to observe how these queries may influence user profiling over time.

These scripts provide a way to run and observe interactions with both voice and web interfaces in an automated fashion.

There are also two folders `Amazon Queries` and `Google Queries` containing the queries we used in our experiments for Amazon and Google and Siri. (We used the same Google queries for Siri as discussed in the paper).


### Security/Privacy Issues and Ethical Concerns (All badges)

- **Account Credentials:** Since the `seleniumscript.py` script requires reviewers to enter their Google login credentials, there is a risk associated with storing and processing these credentials. Reviewers should use a test account rather than a personal or sensitive account to avoid unintended data exposure. Additionally, please ensure that credentials are not stored in code files or shared inadvertently.
- **Intended Use:** The artifact should only be used for research and review purposes as intended by the submission guidelines. The automation scripts are not intended for any malicious or unauthorized use.
